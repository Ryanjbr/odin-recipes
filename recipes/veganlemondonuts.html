        <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) water</li>
        <li>1 cup (148g) gluten free flour OR all-purpose flour (125g) (see important notes about flour below)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup (50g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>½ cup (120ml) unsweetened non-dairy milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon lemon extract</li>
    </ul>
    <label>For the Lemon Glaze:</label>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
    <li>Grease your doughnut pan (if needed).</li>
    <li>Prepare your flax egg by whisking together ground flax seeds and water. Set aside to thicken.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, and lemon zest.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the milk, melted coconut oil, lemon extract, and flax mixture together.</li>
    <li>Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix well to combine. Don't over mix.</li>
    <li>Using a piping bag or a large Ziploc bag (see note below), pipe the mixture into each cavity.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and let the pan sit for a few minutes before removing the doughnuts.</li>
    <li>Remove the doughnuts from the pan and place on a cooling rack.</li>
    </ol>
    <label>While the doughnuts are cooling, make the glaze:</label>
    <ol>
    <li>Add the powdered sugar to a small bowl and add the lemon juice, and lemon zest (if using).</li>
    <li>Mix until everything has combined into a liquid glaze.</li>
    <li>When the doughnuts have fully cooled (they don't take long!), dip the tops of each doughnut into the glaze. Repeat with all the doughnuts.</li>
    <li>Place the doughnuts back onto the cooling rack for the excess glaze to drip off and for the glaze to firm up. (Place a piece of parchment paper under the rack to catch the drips!)</li>
    </ol>
